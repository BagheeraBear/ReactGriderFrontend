Client code
You will need to have a Java runtime installed on your machine to run Swagger. To generate client code, you first need to install Swagger Codegen. On macOS, you may use Homebrew:

$ brew install swagger-codegen maven
To generate code in a given language, run swagger-codegen generate and pass the following parameters:

--input-spec <spec file>: Use https://developers.strava.com/swagger/swagger.json for Stravaâ€™s API
--config <configuration file>: (optional) pass the settings or overrides you want the code generator to honor
--lang <language>: the target programming language you seek to generate code for (running swagger-codegen by itself will print a list of available languages)
--output <output directory>: where to write the resulting files
This example will generate Java code suitable to be packaged in an Android library:

$ swagger-codegen generate -i https://developers.strava.com/swagger/swagger.json -l java -o generated/java
